## ðŸŽ¯ Introduction
In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, maintaining a healthy lifestyle is more important than ever.  
However, in the Arabic-speaking region, health and wellness services are often fragmented â€” requiring users to switch between multiple apps for fitness, nutrition, injury recovery, and communication. This leads to a poor user experience, reduced motivation, and inconsistent results.

On the other hand, certified health professionals struggle to find a single platform to showcase their expertise, connect with clients, and manage long-term relationships.

**Nezamk** solves these problems by offering:
- One integrated platform for all health-related services.
- Direct connection between users and verified professionals.
- Tools for personalized, culturally relevant, and trackable health plans.

This project bridges the gap between clients and professionals, making health services more accessible, efficient, and engaging.
